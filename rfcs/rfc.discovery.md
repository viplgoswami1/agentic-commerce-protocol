# RFC: Agentic Checkout — Discovery

**Status:** Proposal  
**Version:** unreleased  
**Scope:** Discovery document for seller capabilities in the Agentic Commerce Protocol

This RFC introduces a well-known discovery document (`/.well-known/acp.json`) for the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**. The document allows agents to determine whether a seller supports ACP, which protocol version is available, what transports are offered, and what capabilities the seller provides, all before creating a checkout session and without requiring authentication.

---

## 1. Motivation

The Agentic Commerce Protocol's capability negotiation (see `rfc.capability_negotiation.md`) enables rich, session-level negotiation between agents and sellers during checkout session creation. However, agents currently have no way to answer a more fundamental question: **"Does this seller support ACP at all?"**

Without a discovery mechanism:

- **Blind first requests**: Agents must attempt `POST /checkout_sessions` and interpret failure responses to determine if a seller even supports ACP. This creates unnecessary sessions and wastes API calls.
- **Version ambiguity**: Agents have no way to determine the supported API version before making a request, potentially leading to version mismatch errors on the first call.
- **No feature overview**: Agents cannot know which extensions or services a seller supports (e.g., orders, discounts, delegate payment) without starting a transaction.
- **No base URL bootstrapping**: Agents need the full API base URL to make any ACP call. Without discovery, the base URL must be communicated entirely out-of-band.
- **No caching opportunity**: Every new checkout session re-discovers the same seller capabilities that rarely change.

### Why not use inline capabilities alone?

Inline capabilities (the `capabilities` object on `POST /checkout_sessions`) are the authoritative mechanism for **session-level** negotiation. They correctly handle:

- **Merchant-specific capabilities**: Payment methods, payment handlers, and PSP configurations that vary per merchant.
- **Feature-flagged rollouts**: Capabilities that are under gradual rollout and may vary between transactions.
- **Context-dependent capabilities**: Features that depend on order amount, buyer location, item type, or other session-specific context.

Discovery addresses a different concern: the seller's capabilities that are stable and deterministic. When a Seller Platform hosts on behalf of multiple sellers, this information is shared across all sellers on that platform. The two mechanisms are complementary.

---

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

1. **Pre-flight compatibility check**: Enable agents to determine ACP support and version compatibility before creating sessions.
2. **Base URL bootstrapping**: Allow agents to discover the API base URL from just a domain name.
3. **No authentication required**: The document MUST be publicly accessible without a Bearer token.
4. **Cacheability**: Responses SHOULD be cacheable to avoid redundant requests for stable information.
5. **Seller-scoped**: Return information that describes the seller's capabilities (or, when hosted by a Seller Platform, capabilities shared across all sellers on that platform).
6. **Simplicity**: Keep the document schema minimal and focused on information that helps agents decide whether and how to interact with the seller.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- **Merchant-specific discovery**: Capabilities that vary per merchant (payment methods, payment handlers, PSP configurations) are out of scope. These are negotiated via the `capabilities` object on `POST /checkout_sessions`.
- **Session-level negotiation**: This document does not replace or duplicate the inline capability exchange. It provides a higher-level overview.
- **Product or catalog discovery**: Discovering what a merchant sells (products, inventory, pricing) is out of scope.
- **Agent registration or whitelisting**: Agent identity and authorization are separate concerns (see GitHub Issue #15).
- **Merchant enumeration**: When hosted by a Seller Platform, the discovery document MUST NOT accept or return `merchant_id` or any merchant-specific identifiers. Because the document is unauthenticated, exposing merchant identity would allow anyone to enumerate which sellers exist on a Seller Platform, creating a fingerprinting and enumeration risk.

---

## 3. Design Rationale

### 3.1 Deployment models

The seller hosts `/.well-known/acp.json` to declare its capabilities. There are two deployment models:

1. **Direct hosting**: The seller hosts the discovery document at its own domain (e.g., `merchant.example.com`). The document describes that seller's capabilities directly.

2. **Seller Platform hosting**: A Seller Platform (e.g., Stripe) hosts the discovery document on behalf of many sellers. In this model:
   - **One base URL serves many sellers** with heterogeneous capabilities.
   - **Seller identity is established through authentication** (Bearer token), which is unavailable at discovery time.
   - **Seller-specific capabilities are not deterministic**: they may be subject to feature flags, gradual rollouts, A/B testing, or session-context rules.

In both models, the discovery document describes capabilities that are stable and shared. Seller-specific or session-specific capabilities (payment methods, payment handlers) are negotiated via the `capabilities` object on `POST /checkout_sessions`.

### 3.2 Why `.well-known` instead of a dedicated API endpoint?

Discovery solves a bootstrapping problem: agents need to learn the API base URL before they can call any endpoint. A `/.well-known/acp.json` document at the origin root solves this because:

1. **Agents only need a domain**: Given `merchant.example.com`, an agent fetches `https://merchant.example.com/.well-known/acp.json` and discovers the API base URL, supported versions, and capabilities in a single request. No prior knowledge of the API path structure is needed.
2. **RFC 8615 precedent**: Well-known URIs are the established standard for protocol-level discovery. OpenID Connect (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`), OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`), and Matrix (`/.well-known/matrix/server`) all use this pattern.
3. **Static document**: The content describes the seller's capabilities and changes infrequently. It can be served as a static file by a CDN or web server with no application logic required.

### 3.3 Why not include payment methods?

Payment method availability is:

1. **Merchant-specific**: Merchant A may accept Visa and Mastercard; Merchant B may accept only Apple Pay.
2. **Feature-flagged**: A merchant may be rolling out a new payment method at 10% of transactions.
3. **Context-dependent**: Available payment methods may vary based on order amount, buyer location, or item type.

Including payment methods in an unauthenticated discovery document would be either inaccurate (showing the union) or misleading (showing a subset). Session-level negotiation is the correct mechanism.

## 4. Specification

### 4.1 Document Location

```
/.well-known/acp.json
```

The document MUST be served at the origin root per RFC 8615. For a seller hosted at `https://merchant.example.com`, the document URL is `https://merchant.example.com/.well-known/acp.json`. When a Seller Platform hosts on behalf of sellers (e.g., `https://acp.stripe.com`), the document URL is `https://acp.stripe.com/.well-known/acp.json`.

**Content-Type**: `application/json`

**Authentication**: None required. The document MUST be publicly accessible without a Bearer token.

**Caching**: Implementations SHOULD include a `Cache-Control` response header with a minimum of `public, max-age=3600`. Seller capabilities do not change frequently; without cache guidance, agents will either re-fetch on every checkout flow (unnecessary load) or cache too aggressively (stale data after version upgrades). Implementations SHOULD NOT update the document more frequently than once per hour.

### 4.2 Response Schema

The document is a `DiscoveryResponse` object containing the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | `DiscoveryProtocol` | Yes | Protocol identification and version information. |
| `api_base_url` | `string` (URI) | Yes | Base URL for the ACP REST API. Agents append resource paths to this URL. |
| `transports` | `string[]` | Yes | Transport bindings supported by this seller (e.g., `["rest"]` or `["rest", "mcp"]`). See [SEP #135](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-protocol/agentic-commerce-protocol/issues/135) for the MCP transport binding. |

| `version` | `string` | Yes | Current (latest) API version, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
| `supported_versions` | `string[]` | Yes | All API versions the seller supports, in chronological order (oldest first). The last element is always the latest supported version. |
| `documentation_url` | `string` (URI) | No | URL to the seller's ACP documentation. |

#### DiscoveryCapabilities

|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | Extension identifier (e.g., `"discount"`, `"fulfillment"`). |
| `spec` | `string` (URI) | No | URL to the extension's specification document. |
| `schema` | `string` (URI) | No | URL to the extension's JSON Schema definition for programmatic validation. |

#### Services Enum Values

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `checkout` | Checkout session management (`POST /checkout_sessions` and related endpoints). |
| `orders` | Post-purchase order lifecycle management. |
| `delegate_payment` | Payment credential delegation (`POST /delegate_payment`). |

The `services` enum is closed per API version. New values are introduced in new API versions. Agents MAY treat the set as exhaustive for a given version.

#### Transports Enum Values

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `rest` | REST API at the URL specified by `api_base_url`. |
| `mcp` | Model Context Protocol server (see [SEP #135](https://github.com/agentic-commerce-protocol/agentic-commerce-protocol/issues/135)). |

The `transports` enum is closed per API version. New values are introduced in new API versions. Agents MAY treat the set as exhaustive for a given version.

#### Intervention Types Enum Values

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `3ds` | 3D Secure authentication. |
| `biometric` | Biometric verification (fingerprint, Face ID, etc.). |
| `address_verification` | Address verification service. |

The `intervention_types` enum is closed per API version. New values are introduced in new API versions. Agents MAY treat the set as exhaustive for a given version.

### 4.3 HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Success. Returns `DiscoveryResponse`. |
| `404 Not Found` | Seller does not support ACP. |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded. |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Temporary unavailability. |

### 4.4 Error Handling

Rate limiting and service unavailability responses SHOULD include a `Retry-After` header. A `404` response indicates the seller does not support ACP; agents SHOULD NOT retry.

    "supported_locales": ["en-US", "fr-FR", "de-DE"]
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Minimal Response (Direct Seller)

```json
{
  "protocol": {
    "name": "acp",
    "version": "2025-09-29",
    "supported_versions": ["2025-09-29"]
  },
  "api_base_url": "https://merchant.example.com/api",
  "transports": ["rest"],
  "capabilities": {
    "services": ["checkout"]
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Agent Decision Flow

An agent uses discovery to bootstrap its interaction with a seller:

1. Agent knows the seller's domain (e.g., `merchant.example.com` or `acp.stripe.com`).
2. Agent fetches `https://{domain}/.well-known/acp.json`.
3. Agent receives a `200` response: the seller supports ACP.
4. Agent reads `api_base_url` to learn where to send API requests.
5. Agent checks `protocol.supported_versions` to confirm its preferred API version is listed.
6. Agent checks `capabilities.services` to confirm `"checkout"` is available.
7. Agent checks `capabilities.extensions` to see if `"discount"` is supported, informing whether to include discount codes in the checkout request.
8. Agent checks `transports` to determine whether to use REST or MCP.
9. Agent proceeds to `POST {api_base_url}/checkout_sessions` with its inline capabilities for session-level negotiation.

If the agent receives a `404` or non-JSON response at step 2, it knows the seller does not support ACP and should use an alternative channel.

---

## 6. Relation to Capability Negotiation

Discovery and capability negotiation are complementary mechanisms at different scopes:

| Aspect | Discovery (`/.well-known/acp.json`) | Capability Negotiation (`POST /checkout_sessions`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Seller's capabilities | Session-specific capabilities |
| **Authentication** | None required | Bearer token required |
| **Content** | Protocol version, services, extensions, transports | Payment methods, payment handlers, intervention intersection |
| **Variability** | Stable across sessions | Varies per session, per rollout state |
| **Cacheability** | Cacheable (hours to days) | Per-session only |
| **Purpose** | "Can I use ACP here? Where is the API?" | "What works for this transaction?" |

Discovery does not replace inline capabilities. An agent that reads `/.well-known/acp.json` still MUST include the `capabilities` object in `POST /checkout_sessions` for session-specific negotiation.

---

## 7. Security and Privacy

### 7.1 No Sensitive Data

The discovery document contains only the seller's capabilities. It MUST NOT include:

- Merchant identifiers or configuration
- Payment handler details or PSP routing
- Buyer or customer information
- Authentication tokens or keys

### 7.2 Rate Limiting

Implementations SHOULD apply rate limiting to prevent abuse. The document is publicly accessible, making it a potential target for scraping or denial-of-service. Standard `429 Too Many Requests` responses with `Retry-After` headers are RECOMMENDED.

### 7.3 Information Disclosure

The document reveals which ACP features a seller supports. This is considered public, non-sensitive information comparable to publishing an OpenAPI spec. Implementations SHOULD NOT include information that could be used for seller fingerprinting or competitive intelligence.

### 7.4 Merchant Enumeration

When hosted by a Seller Platform, the discovery document MUST NOT accept or return merchant identifiers. Because the document is unauthenticated, exposing seller-specific information would allow anyone to enumerate which sellers exist on a Seller Platform, creating fingerprinting and competitive intelligence risks.

---

## 8. Backward Compatibility

This is a purely additive change:

- **New document**: `/.well-known/acp.json` is a new resource that does not conflict with any existing endpoints or paths.
- **New schemas**: `DiscoveryResponse`, `DiscoveryCapabilities`, `DiscoveryProtocol`, and `DiscoveryExtension` are new schemas that do not modify any existing schemas.
- **No changes to existing flows**: The `POST /checkout_sessions` flow and its inline capability negotiation are completely unchanged.

Agents that do not use discovery continue to work exactly as before. Discovery is an optional pre-flight check.

## 11. Future Extensions

This RFC provides a foundation for future discovery enhancements:

- **Webhook capabilities**: Advertising supported webhook event types and delivery mechanisms.
- **Authentication methods**: Declaring supported authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0 identity linking) when those capabilities are added to ACP.
- **Service-level metadata**: Adding per-service configuration (e.g., maximum line items, supported fulfillment types) as the seller's feature set grows.
- **Transport endpoint discovery**: Structured transport objects with per-transport endpoint URLs (e.g., `{"type": "rest", "url": "..."}`, `{"type": "mcp", "url": "..."}`), enabling agents to discover MCP and other transport endpoints directly from the discovery document. Deferred pending MCP binding finalization (SEP #135).
- **Signing keys**: Public key advertisement (JWK format) for signature verification, enabling agents to verify the authenticity of responses. Deferred pending formalization of ACP's request signing specification.

---

## 12. Change Log

- **2026-02-11**: Initial proposal for platform-level discovery via `GET /capabilities`.
- **2026-02-23**: Switched to `/.well-known/acp.json` per RFC 8615 based on reviewer feedback. Added `api_base_url`, `transports` fields. Wrapped capabilities in a `capabilities` object. Added closed-enum versioning guidance for `services`, `intervention_types`, and `transports`. Added `merchant_id` enumeration risk to non-goals. Added minimum `Cache-Control` recommendation. Added cross-reference to SEP #135 (MCP Transport Binding).
